    <h1>Details for Valentine's Plans!</h1>
    <p>We'll be going to <strong>Francesca's Tavola</strong> in Downtown Arlington Heights! It is this VERY CUTE Italian place that you can dress up to. It looks so nice but is not overly expensive (because I know you said no more pricey gifts). Try to open up around 2.5 hours of time (7-9:30, I recommend saying a birthday)?</p>
    <p>After we finish eating there, we can share an ice cream from Kilwin's and take some pics under all the lighting.</p>
    <p><strong>DRESS PRETTY NICELY</strong> (feel free to ask any questions). Hopefully, I'll be able to pick you up and drop you off.</p>
    <p>Sorry for all the trouble and frustrations and lack of communication recently. I haven't been myself (partially because of how much time this whole thing has been eating up, but also just my lack of structured time, poor planning habits, and constant sleeping) I really hope you like this ask and I know it is not the most well put together but it's what I was able to get done. I'll really try to make this dinner worth it to make up for this. I love you so so much Shruti, and Happy Valentine's beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
